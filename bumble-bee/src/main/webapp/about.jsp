                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Bumble Bee was founded in 2021 with the aim of providing 
                        easy and accessible loans to people who want to buy 
                        products online. We understand the importance of financial
                        flexibility and that's why we offer interest-free 
                        installment plans for our customers.</p>
                    

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is to empower people to make the purchases they need and 
                        want without worrying about the immediate financial burden. 
                        We believe that everyone deserves access to financial opportunities 
                        and that's what we strive to provide through our platform.</p>

                <h2>Our Team</h2>
                    <p>Our team is made up of experienced professionals from the financial
                        and technology industries. We work tirelessly to ensure that our 
                        platform is secure, user-friendly, and accessible to all.</p>
